**Key**: C

Available Behaviors:
- Default: The empty slot is the implicit slot and thus will not be added explicitly. The displayed name on an item is used as item name in the UI template item definition.
- Shift+Key: Fill with blank by default mode: Change the implicit slot to Black Stained Glass Pane (Blank), so it will not be added explicitly. The empty slot will be added explicitly.
- Control+Key: Always use Minecraft item name for non skull items mode:
  - For player heads, since the item name "Player Head" is often not useful, the displayed name is used as item name in the UI template item definition.
  - For all other items, the English Minecraft item name is used as item name in the UI template item definition. If an item is enchanted, the item name becomes `Enchanted <Minecraft item name>`.

#### Copy Skull ID

Copy the texture ID of a skull to your clipboard. With this ID, the corresponding skin file can be downloaded on `https://textures.minecraft.net/texture/<ID>`.
